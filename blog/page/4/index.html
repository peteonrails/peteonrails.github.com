  <div class="entry-content">My friend and colleague <a href="http://blog.notedpath.com/2008/07/05/to-be-more-educated-or-not/">Theo Nguyen-Cao posted on his blog about considering graduate school</a>. He inspired me to dig up some reflections on my B-School experience and my startup lifestyle. 

I&#8217;ve learned a few things working on startups while going to B-School. Here&#8217;s just one: 

<strong>Creation of value means more than selling more</strong>
Delivering value to shareholders is often cited as a business objective. Certainly that is a component of what value creation entails, but thereâ€™s more to it. There are elements of value creation that include building better products for customers, aligning organizational and social objectives, and reducing impacts to other parties.

  <div class="entry-content">Self-organization and empowerment of teams has a really powerful influence on success. I had a garden one year that I micromanaged. I pruned it, weeded it, watered it, fertilized it, and generally over-managed. It died. The next year, I did a whole lot less micromanaging, and it grew to produce a lot of fruits. People are similar.

  <div class="entry-content">Innovation is not efficient. It is inherently wasteful. There is churn and rework. However, it is the only strategy to sustain a competitive advantage. So to the extent that you can organize your teams and processes to embrace this fact, you will be successful.

  <div class="entry-content"><a href="http://drnicwilliams.com/">Dr Nic</a> is a seriously productive badass. I can&#8217;t manage to keep up with all of his github projects. I read his blog: frankly, he doesn&#8217;t post all that often. But it seems like he&#8217;s got a <a href="http://github.com/drnic">new github project</a> every couple of days. 

Seriously, I&#8217;m not sure how the guy cranks it all out. These are **not**  piddly little projects. One day, he&#8217;ll publish a new framework. Then he&#8217;ll fork something trivial like&#8230;.oh&#8230;I dunno&#8230;Merb. And fix a ton of bugs. Then he&#8217;ll publish a handful of TextMate bundles that he developed while working on the framework. Then he&#8217;ll decide he wants to publish a few snippets and out comes PastiePacker. 

Check out a few of his projects. Most of them are small, focused, and very useful. They&#8217;re good stuff. My current fave is the <a href="http://github.com/drnic/iphoneruby/tree/master"> iPhone Ruby</a> project. 

It&#8217;s teh chown.

  <div class="entry-content">I like to keep up with developer blogs, so I definitely read/watch <a href="railscasts.com">Railscasts</a>, <a href="http://www.intridea.com/blog/">The Intridea Blog</a>, <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, <a href="http://paulgraham.com/articles.html">Paul Graham</a>, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a> and the like. 

However, I get a lot of utility out of following the blogs of lesser known people I know or have worked with. If you haven&#8217;t checked them out already, please visit my peeps on their blogs: 
 
<ul>
<li><a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/">Fred Wilson</a>: Ok. Not really one of my peeps, per se, but a smart guy who I respect and read daily. </li>
<li><a href="http://seancook.com/">Sean Cook</a>: If you know or have worked with me, it&#8217;s likely that you know or have worked with Sean. He&#8217;s starting to ramp up the content on his site with technical stuff, but the music stuff if worth a visit.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.acts-as-blogr.com">Brent Collier</a>: The other of the two brains behind Yappd.com.</li>
<li><a href="http://punkrockhr.com/">Laurie Ruettimann</a>: I haven&#8217;t met her in person, but her HR blog makes so much sense that nobody in the startup world can afford to not read it.</li>

  <div class="entry-content">This week was one of the toughest I&#8217;ve had to go through at work. Here&#8217;s a completely random set of things that have made me smile in the last 24 hours. 

<a href="http://www.cheerios.com/ourCereals/FruityCheerios/FruityCheerios_home.aspx"><strong>Fruity Cheerios</strong></a>. -  It&#8217;s like eating Froot Loops, but they&#8217;re called Cheerios. All of the pleasure with none of the guilt. 

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggrOcBWqHiU"><strong>Yo Gabba Gabba!</strong></a> - It&#8217;s a slightly ridiculous, but amusing kids show. Today, I curled up with my kids on the couch and ate fruity cheerios with them while watching the &#8220;Party In My Tummy&#8221; episdoe. 

<a href="http://punkrockhr.com/"><strong>Punk Rock HR </strong></a>  - Laurie Ruettimann used to work for Big HR, but after becoming unemployed a year ago, she started writing a blog about opting out of the corporate rat race. It contains such gems as &#8220;The Punk Rock Employee Handbook&#8221; and some refreshing quips like: 

- Team building is for suckers. 
- Office Speak is for Suckers.
- &#8220;Youâ€™re not cool and ironic. Trust me. Youâ€™re not.&#8221;

I think she likes to call people &#8220;suckers&#8221;. But in any case: read her stuff. Very amusing.

  <div class="entry-content">Fred WIlson makes a great point today about how<a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2008/06/comments-can-be.html">blog comments can be as important as blog posts themselves</a>. In this post, he says: 

<blockquote>
 I want to be able to easily reblog onto my front page any and all great comments in a format that shows that they are comments and a link to the post the comment is from. I want to be able to easily reblog the comments I make on other blogs to my blog. I want services like techmeme and friendfeed to understand that comments are as important as blog posts (friendfeed is on its way with disqus and intensedebate integration). And I want commenters to have their own blogs that are simply aggregations of the comments they leave on the web. That&#8217;s happening too, here&#8217;s my disqus page.
</blockquote>

Great stuff. I agree. I often paraphrase my comment back onto my blog as a new post. And, <a href="http://disqus.com/people/peteonrails/">my disqus page</a> is almost a blog on its own. However, I&#8217;d really like to have the option in either my blog software or on my disqus page to &#8220;Reblog this comment as a new post&#8221; on my main blog page. 

The <a href="http://disqus.com/developers/">Disqus API</a> should make this kinda trivial to support in most blog software. But how do we get the maintainers of Blogger, WordPress, Typo, and the dozen other blog providers to support it? I can tell you from experience that getting it into Typo as a patch will take more time than writing the code itself. 

So how about a javascript badge that will do it? That shouldn&#8217;t be too hard. Who&#8217;s working on it?

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2008-06-08T00:00:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jun 8<span>th</span>, 2008</time>

  <div class="entry-content">The new Rails routing has nice support for nested reources. And, I think it handles just enough nesting. Any more support, and it&#8217;s possible to go overboard and write ugly code. 

For example, here is what Rails now supports for nested routing syntax: 

<pre lang="ruby" line="1">
  # Simple parent child association
  map.resources :user, :has_many => :posts

  # A parent with many types of children
  map.resources :posts, :has_many => [:comments, :trackbacks, :pingbacks ]
</pre>
Nice. That is prefectly terse and descriptive, without being too clever. 

There has been some debate and consternation over why a complicated multi-nested resource can&#8217;t be set up this way. For example, if I am building a project management tool, why can&#8217;t I do this?

<pre lang="ruby" line="1">
map.resources :projects, 
  :has_many => [ :releases,  :milestones => [:tasks, {:features => :tasks}] } ]
</pre>
That is, a project has many releases AND milestones, and in turn milestones have many tasks and features. And, features can also have tasks. 

That&#8217;s complicated, and too much cleveness to jam into one statement. I think Rails 2.0.2 / 2.1 has it right in making you write that routing rule like this: 

<pre lang="ruby" line="1">
  map.resources :projects do |project|
    project.resources :releases
    project.resources :milestones do |milestone| 
      milestone.resources :tasks
      milestone.resources :features do |feature|
        feature.resources :tasks
      end
    end
  end
</pre>
I hear a crowd of people clamoring for the uber-terse syntax outlined in the second listing. I think that&#8217;s a <strong>bad idea</strong>. It encourages hard-to-follow, obfuscated code. 

When you have to do something complicated, it&#8217;s worth taking a few extra lines to make it clear to the next programmer.

  <div class="entry-content">Sorry for the outage on this blog yesterday. My hosting provider upgraded to Rails 2.1, and I had cleverly forgotten to:

<pre lang="bash">
bash# rake freeze:rails:gems
</pre>

If this happens to you, and you make the unfortunate mistake of trying to instead update Typo to Rails 2.1 using: 
<pre lang="bash">
bash# rake rails:update
</pre>

You&#8217;ll be in even worse trouble, unless you&#8217;re prepared to do a lot of fixing: 
<pre lang="bash">
bash# Pete$ script/server
./script/../config/boot.rb:45:in `require': no such file to load -- ./script/../config/../vendor/rails/railties/lib/initializer (LoadError)
	from ./script/../config/boot.rb:45:in `load_initializer'
	from ./script/../config/boot.rb:38:in `run'
	from ./script/../config/boot.rb:11:in `boot!'
	from ./script/../config/boot.rb:109
	from script/server:2:in `require'
	from script/server:2
</pre>

Your best bet? Revert from source control and freeze Typo in your dev environment. If you&#8217;re stuck without source control or a dev environment, let me know and I&#8217;ll talk walk you through the alternate fix.
