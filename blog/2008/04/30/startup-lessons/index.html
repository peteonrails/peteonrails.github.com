<div class="entry-content"><p>This is an extension of an article I wrote on my <a href="http://peterjacksonmd.livejournal.com/3032.html#cutid1">Livejournal</a> a couple years ago. Since many Rails developers work for small startups or are themselves starting up a business, I thought I&#8217;d update it with some reflections from the past couple years I&#8217;ve spent working in a scrappy startup.</p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Arial,Helvetica"><i><b>Top 10 Startup Lessons</b></i></font></p>
<p><strong>1. There is no better way to ensure attendance at a 7:00 AM conference call</strong> than to schedule it yourself, invite your employees, and discuss something important. At my startups, we held a daily briefing. It lasted 15 minutes. We got a lot done in 15 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>2. Skype, GotoMeeting, Vonage, VirtualPBX, </strong>and other services are incredibly cheap ways to get big company communications services quickly. And they tend to just &quot;work.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>3. Accountants, Lawyers, and Benefits Administrators </strong> cost so much because they are worth it. Outsource everything that is not related to growing your business. Corollary: In the startup days, don&#8217;t buy anything you don&#8217;t absolutely need unless it makes strategic sense to do so. You generally don&#8217;t need recruiters, expensive server software, top of the line new machines, or a country club membership to woo clients. You do, however, need the best people you can get, tooling, basic processes, and the facility to encourage innovation.</p>
<p><strong>4. Hire slowly</strong>, but fire quickly.</p>
<p><strong>5. Get an Advisory Board</strong> Get one. Make sure they are successful people you can trust. You don&#8217;t have to know them terribly closely. FOAF is adequate.</p>
<p><strong>6. You can start a business working half days.</strong> Whichever 12 hours you want.</p>
<p><strong>7. Small business professional services is about babysitting. </strong> Employees, clients, partners, vendors, etc. They all need babysitting from time to time.</p>
<p><strong>8. Everything you learned in B school was wrong, and it was also right. </strong> Because you see, it depends. I often found myself asked by my partners for the magic bullet they taught us in B school that would solve problem X. The magic bullet is a myth. They simply made sure we know how to think in B school. Or, at least, I think that was the point.</p>
<p><strong>9. Don&#8217;t underestimate the power of your network. But don&#8217;t overestimate it either. </strong> Or, put another way, start a business, and you will quickly find out who you can count on. Don&#8217;t hold it against your friends if they can&#8217;t help you. After all, business is business. Friendship ought not be business (even though a version of it is the oldest business model around). And, don&#8217;t be suprised if you get a 6-figure contract from someone you had on your 5-th round call list. If that does happen, move that person up in your CRM system. Oh, and use a CRM system. Preferably a free one.</p>
<p><strong>10. There is no reason to shower and change out of your pajamas for a 7AM conference call. </strong> Unless it&#8217;s a video iChat and you forgot.</p>
