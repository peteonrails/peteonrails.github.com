<p>Code Highlighting in Typo is awful, cumbersome, and a pain. I am currently running this blog on Typo 5.0.3, and when I write an article using typo:code snippets using LivePreview, here is what I see:   </p>
<p>

</p>

<p>
But then it RENDERS like this, no matter which theme I am using:   
</p>

GAH! That's not what I thought I was getting! No friggin bueno!   So I decided to try a third party code highlighter. 

I really liked the <a href="http://www.unboundimagination.com/Rails-Plugin:-TextMate-Syntax-Highlighting">TextMate Syntax Highlighter</a>, but: it didn't work either.  

My friend and former colleague <a href="http://www.brendanlim.com">Brendan</a> pointed me to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/">a javascript-based code highlighter</a> that does the formatting on the browser. That makes good sense to me. I like it. But it didn't work either.   

So, I've decided to roll up my sleeves and figure out why none of the included themes in Typo will render the code blocks the way I want. 2 hours later, I hate the CSS mess, so I'm spending my evening ripping the whole set of stylesheets apart to make them work right.   

Stay tuned.
