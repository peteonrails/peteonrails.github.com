I spent today wrapping up some code into open source packages. There are a few new toys available to play with.
<ol>
	<li>A new <a href="http://github.com/peteonrails/my-rails-utils/blob/master/fasteragile.rb">Rails Project Template</a> that replaces my old shell-script based project generator.</li>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/peteonrails/seo-kit">SEO Kit</a> - A Rails Engine that provides Canonical Link Tags and Sitemap Generators. It "just works" after you run the generator. No copying, pasting, or code to move around.</li>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/peteonrails/simple_tooltips">simple toolips</a> - If you use Prototype and want simple, not fancy tooltips, you might like these. If you use Prototype and want something FANCY, then buy Prototip. If you use jQuery, you should instead use qTip or jQuery.tooltip.js. The only reason I am publishing this library is because I often have to do simple popup help and this is a very simple way to do it.</li>
</ol>
<div>I'll write up each project in turn, but for now, you can see / get the code at the links provided in the list.</div>
<div>Enjoy!</div>
