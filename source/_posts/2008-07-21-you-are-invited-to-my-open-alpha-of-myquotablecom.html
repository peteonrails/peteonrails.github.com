Quotes. I love quoting people. I have a ton of quotes saved in text files, on my blog, in my various mood messages on IM platforms, and who-know-where-else.

I decided to build an application to manage, organize, and syndicate quotes. You can read more about it <a href="http://blog.peteonrails.com/myquotablecom/"> on my project page for MyQuotable</a>.

If you read this blog, you are invited to participate in my open alpha of <a href="http://www.myquotable.com">MyQuotable.com</a>.
