Dr. Nic has released a <a href="http://drnicwilliams.com/2008/05/03/github-badge-for-your-blog/"> javascript based badge for GitHub</a>. While I generally like to keep my sidebars clean because most readers just ignore the cruft in there, this badge is really useful for me. Plus, as the author points out, you get at least a 100% boost in coolness. 

I like the badge, but it's a little less than seamless looking in my sidebar. He's made the <a href="http://github.com/drnic/github-badges/tree/master">source code</a> available on github (of course), so I could download it and style it to my liking, but I'd much rather benefit from his future releases without having to re-download and merge. 

Specifically, I'd like to be able to suppress the header the badge prints, so I can wrap it into a Typo plugin for a better look. 

Working on a patch now to do just that.
