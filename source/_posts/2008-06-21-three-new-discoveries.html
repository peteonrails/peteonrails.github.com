This week was one of the toughest I've had to go through at work. Here's a completely random set of things that have made me smile in the last 24 hours. 

<a href="http://www.cheerios.com/ourCereals/FruityCheerios/FruityCheerios_home.aspx"><strong>Fruity Cheerios</strong></a>. -  It's like eating Froot Loops, but they're called Cheerios. All of the pleasure with none of the guilt. 

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggrOcBWqHiU"><strong>Yo Gabba Gabba!</strong></a> - It's a slightly ridiculous, but amusing kids show. Today, I curled up with my kids on the couch and ate fruity cheerios with them while watching the "Party In My Tummy" episdoe. 

<a href="http://punkrockhr.com/"><strong>Punk Rock HR </strong></a>  - Laurie Ruettimann used to work for Big HR, but after becoming unemployed a year ago, she started writing a blog about opting out of the corporate rat race. It contains such gems as "The Punk Rock Employee Handbook" and some refreshing quips like: 

- Team building is for suckers. 
- Office Speak is for Suckers.
- "Youâ€™re not cool and ironic. Trust me. Youâ€™re not."

I think she likes to call people "suckers". But in any case: read her stuff. Very amusing.
