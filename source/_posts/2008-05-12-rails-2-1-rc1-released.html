Well, it's happened. The Rails 2.1 RC1 release has been tagged at github. If you haven't already downloaded it after hearing the news on your iPhone RSS Railscast feed, then head on over to <A href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/105">Railscasts.com</a> and watch Ryan's short video on how to install it.
