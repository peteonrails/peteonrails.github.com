I went to B-School when I was stuck in a corporate job, looking for a way to climb to the next level of misery. By my last year of MBA classes, I had made a radical 180 in my thinking. Smart people don't need to stick with lousy jobs. That is follower behavior. Lead and make a great job for yourself and others.
