I saw this posted on <a href="http://brighter.net">Jacqui Maher's blog</a> today and was so amused I had to reblog it.
<pre lang="javascript">if (!(typeof worldHasEnded == "undefined")) {
   document.write("YUP.");
} else {
   document.write("NOPE.");
}</pre>
From <a href="http://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/"> http://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/</a>.

Aside from the very obvious "you don't need to negate that test condition, just reverse your simple if and else clauses" issue, it's quite amusing.

Clever. I like it.
