I've had it. I am moving from Typo to Wordpress. Why?
<ol>
	<li>Typo is still buggy. I want to spend my blog time blogging, not reading logs/production.log to figure out WTF happened to my site.</li>
	<li>After submitting many patches to Typo 5.0.3 and receiving not even a "Hey, got the patch, thanks..." I have deduced that Typo is not well maintained by anyone.</li>
	<li>All the hosted blog solutions that I want (disqus, etc) have out-of-box integration with WordPress.</li>
</ol>
I still host at RailsPlayground. But now I don't run my blog on Rails.

Sorry Typo.
