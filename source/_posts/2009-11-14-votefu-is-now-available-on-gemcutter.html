To tell you the truth, I hadn't really thought about it. But, it does seem to be what all the cool kids are doing.

Want to see how easy it was to move to GemCutter?

Scarily easy. In under 3 minutes I have a new primary gem source and am set up to publish to GemCutter.

So, why would one want o host Gems on GemCutter? I asked the same question. In a nutshell:
<ol>
	<li>Download counts are shown inline</li>
	<li>Build locally, then push-to-publish. No more waiting to make your way through DJ, BJ, Resque, or whatever the background framework of the day is at <a class="zem_slink" title="GitHub" rel="homepage" href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>.</li>
	<li>It's nothing but gem hosting, so it'll probably grow to do gem hosting really well.</li>
	<li>It's ThoughtBot. I like the ThoughtBot guys.</li>
</ol>
So, there's no real compelling reason to run out and move your gems to GemCutter, but if your users ask you to do it, it takes 3 minutes or less.
