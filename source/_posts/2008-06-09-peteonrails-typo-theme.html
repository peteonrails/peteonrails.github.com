I've released the typo theme you see right now via <a href="http://github.com/peteonrails/por-typo-theme/tree/master">GitHub</a>. I'm probably going to migrate to Mephisto in the next week or so, so this theme will go out of support, but I'll maintain the repository and honor any pull-requests if you want to patch it.
