To that end, I used it for a full season before returning it to try a better pack. <br xmlns:pr="xalan://com.pufferfish.core.beans.xmlbuilders.xsl.Functions"><br>This pack is, hands-down, better than any rope bag available. If you're replacing a rope bag, or avoiding buying one, this is a great way to go. <br><br>That said, it's a pretty bad pack. I found the straps uncomfortable, the lid hard to close when overstuffed, and the side pockets useless for holding anything when carrying a rope longer than 50M. <br><br>Unless you're carrying a super-skinny rope or a 50M sub-10mm rope, you're going to have trouble closing the pack, taking other gear with you, getting anything into those side pockets, and difficulty getting the load to ride correctly. <br><br>Also, I find those gear lashing daisy chains overrated. If you clip your shoes, harness, helmet, or water bottle to the outside of this pack, you'll suffer from an unstable load that snags on trail obstacles. Not ideal. <br><br>I live in Rumney NH, exactly 3/4 mile from the crags, and I'd avoid taking this pack to the cliffs. Instead, I found myself favoring my hiking pack: so I knew something was wrong. <br><br>If you have short approaches, a short rope, not a lot of personal gear, and don't mind the minimal padding on the straps, then this is an excellent pack. <br><br>If you are looking for a rope bag and can have your partner carry the rack, food, and water, then this is the pack for you. <br><br>Otherwise, it may not be.</p><p style="margin-top:0.5em">(<a href="http://www.powerreviews.com/legal/terms_of_use.html" rel="license">legalese</a>)</p></div>
