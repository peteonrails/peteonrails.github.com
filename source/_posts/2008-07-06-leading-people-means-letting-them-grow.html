Self-organization and empowerment of teams has a really powerful influence on success. I had a garden one year that I micromanaged. I pruned it, weeded it, watered it, fertilized it, and generally over-managed. It died. The next year, I did a whole lot less micromanaging, and it grew to produce a lot of fruits. People are similar.
