A couple of contributors forked VoteFu and submitted some patches. I've updated the master branch to integrate the changes. Notably:
<ul>
	<li>VoteFu now works as a standard gem in a Ruby application. (i.e. not as a Rails plugin)</li>
	<li>VoteFu now works as a Rails Gem Plugin.</li>
	<li>VoteFu now works with Rails 2.2.2.</li>
	<li>Other assorted small bugfixes.</li>
</ul>
To install VoteFu as a Gem Plugin:
<pre lang="bash">
sudo gem install peteonrails-vote_fu
</pre>
Then in config/environment.rb: 
<pre lang="ruby">
  config.gem "peteonrails-vote_fu", 
     :source => "http://gems.github.com", 
     :lib => "vote_fu"
</pre>
And then, optionally: 
<pre lang="bash">
rake gems:unpack
</pre>

Special thanks to Jon Maddox and Bence Nagy for the updated code. <a href="http://github.com/peteonrails/vote_fu/tree/master">Check it out yourself!</a>
