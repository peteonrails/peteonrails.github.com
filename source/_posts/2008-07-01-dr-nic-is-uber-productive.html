<a href="http://drnicwilliams.com/">Dr Nic</a> is a seriously productive badass. I can't manage to keep up with all of his github projects. I read his blog: frankly, he doesn't post all that often. But it seems like he's got a <a href="http://github.com/drnic">new github project</a> every couple of days. 

Seriously, I'm not sure how the guy cranks it all out. These are **not**  piddly little projects. One day, he'll publish a new framework. Then he'll fork something trivial like....oh...I dunno...Merb. And fix a ton of bugs. Then he'll publish a handful of TextMate bundles that he developed while working on the framework. Then he'll decide he wants to publish a few snippets and out comes PastiePacker. 

Check out a few of his projects. Most of them are small, focused, and very useful. They're good stuff. My current fave is the <a href="http://github.com/drnic/iphoneruby/tree/master"> iPhone Ruby</a> project. 

It's teh chown.
