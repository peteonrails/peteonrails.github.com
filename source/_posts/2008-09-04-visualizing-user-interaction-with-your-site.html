I really like the app on <a href="http://www.angelsoft.net/">AngelSoft's new homepage.</a>

A long time ago I created an app that would post messages to the homepage in a ticker when site visitors would do stuff. It was for a liberal political action NGO. From the homepage of this NGO's site the ticker would flash messages like "A member just sent a fax to Senator Jim Webb about Senate Bill 1022" or "Bill Jones just became a new member. Welcome Bill!"

I like how they've taken that concept and put it on a map. Nice.

Funny how we forget cool ideas from long ago. And funny how we forget that there's always a chance to build off of old ideas to create newer, better ones. 

Great work, AngelSoft. I expect to see a lot of people follow suit.
