I made myself this promise my first day as Director of Software Engineering for a technology startup. Many people spend a lot of time trying to figure out the political landscape, the business environment, and the legacy on their first day of a new job.

It's a better idea to rely on your own brain. That's why you got hired.

<strong>It's worth speaking your mind early, frequently, and candidly. </strong>

Forget about reputation and fallout. It's much better to tell the truth as you see it, analyze it, and use it to bridge any divides between viewpoints. Sometimes, people that seem to really know what they are talking about...are bluffing. The only way to tell is to dig into what you don't understand.

Call Bullshit. All the time. My boss has come to expect that of me. It's part of my personal brand.
