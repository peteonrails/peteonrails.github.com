Good grief. It's amazing how fast you get buried in comment and trackback Spam. I had a tough week last week, so I hadn't posted much or reviewed comments. This weekend, when I had some time to pay attention to my blog, I found that I had hundreds of spam comments and trackbacks. 

I know. "Quit your complaining, Pete. That's life. We all deal with that crap." 

Well, I hadn't realized just how inundating it can be. So: 

1. I turned on Akismet spam filtering. 
2. I closed older posts to new comments. 
3. I tuned some other settings, including requiring comments to be posted via AJAX. If you have Javascript turned off, you won't be able to comment. 

While I was at it, I enabled <a href="http://en.gravatar.com/">Gravatars.</a> Woot!
