<a href="http://gist.github.com">Gist</a> is a social code pastie service powered by Github. It looks promising, because it adds versioning, history, and some other git-powered goodies to the Pasite hosting world.

But, it's not easy to embed a gist hosted pastie into your blog. Check it out. Here is <a href="http://gist.github.com/2526">My First Gist snippet.</a>

The "embed" link for that snippet says to put this script in my page:
<pre lang="html">
<script src="http://gist.github.com/2526.js"></script>
</pre>
Which I will do right here between two lines of stars.

Firebug tells me: 
unterminated string literal
[Break on this error] <div class="gist-high...equire &quot;threaded_collections&quot;\n

<pre lang="javascript">
