My day job has been keeping me busy-busy-busy, but I had some time this weekend to add some more to MyQuotable.com. Here is what is new:
<ul>
	<li>You can now edit your user profile. (Name, etc)</li>
	<li>The color scheme is slightly different.</li>
	<li>You now collect positive karma every time someone votes for one of your quotes.</li>
	<li>Pagination!</li>
	<li>I refactored the statusbar. Breadcrumbs and navigation work better and more consistently.</li>
</ul>
Next up: Search and Categorization
