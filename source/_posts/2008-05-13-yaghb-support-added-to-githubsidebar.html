Ben Hughes has created a <a href="http://github.com/schleyfox/yaghb/tree/master">simpler github badge for his typo blog</a> that renders a little more smoothly in Typo than Dr. Nic's badge. 

I added support for YAGHB to githubsidebar today. If you like the look of YAGHB better, you can <a href="http://github.com/peteonrails/githubsidebar/tree/master">grab the latest sidebar from github</a>. In the configuration pane, you should now see a set of radio buttons that let you choose which badge to render. 

<a href='http://blog.peteonrails.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/githubsidebar-1.jpg'><img src="http://blog.peteonrails.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/githubsidebar-1-269x300.jpg" alt="" title="githubsidebar-1" width="269" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-43" /></a>

Personally, I like the original badge quite a bit, but Typo users who are having trouble getting it to look right with their theme may want to give YAGHB a try.
