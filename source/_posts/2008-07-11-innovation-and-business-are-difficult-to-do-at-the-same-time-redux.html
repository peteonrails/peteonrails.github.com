In technology, knowledge is the important asset. Sharing knowledge is the important work. Conversations are therefore  the most critical element of the business.

There are particular conversations that are important to facilitate, encourage, and enable. As managers and architects of our businesses, it is important for us to make sure that productive, meaningful information flow is taking place within our organizations.

In an article that I cannot find an online reference to, John Fini suggests that innovators be removed from operation of the business. In <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/Biztech/13565/?a=f">Howard Anderson's TR article detailing the organizational barriers to success</a>, he suggests that the most creative set of people in the organization should have the least red tape to cut.

In my opinion, the only way to make this work in a large organization is to go Agile. If you're in a position to choose, I think this is evidence that you should choose a startup over corporate IT if you care about inventing.
