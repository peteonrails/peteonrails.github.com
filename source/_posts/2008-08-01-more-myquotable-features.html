<a href="http://www.myquotable.com">MyQuotable</a> is a fun project for me. Here is what is new:
<ol>
	<li>Tags:Â  Tag your quotes and filter by those tags.</li>
	<li>/popular: See which quotes have the most votes</li>
	<li>RSS Feeds for Recent, Popular, and User specific quotes.</li>
</ol>
What's next? You tell me. The alpha testers I have so far have had some great feedback. Here is my punchlist:
<ul>
	<li>Quote updates via email</li>
	<li>Pagination</li>
	<li>Wordpress plugin</li>
	<li>Friending / Following</li>
	<li>Tag other user's quotes and View items you have tagged</li>
	<li>View items you have voted on</li>
	<li>Tag cloud view</li>
	<li>Manage my account settings</li>
</ul>
If you haven't given the site a try yet, please do. I welcome your feedback.
