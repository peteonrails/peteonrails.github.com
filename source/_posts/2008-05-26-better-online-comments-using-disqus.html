I'm considering moving my comment system to <a href="http://www.disqus.com">disqus</a>.  I really like how their service helps keep online conversations easy to follow across multiple sites while making it easy not to lose track of the blog where the conversation began. It also lets users see more about a random commenter they come across on a blog. 

Anyone else done this move on a Typo system?
