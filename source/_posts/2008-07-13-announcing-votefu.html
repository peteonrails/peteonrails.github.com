  description: Post describing the release of a new Rails plugin, vote_fu, that enables
    a voting mixin for rails models.
  keywords: acts_as_voteable vote_fu rails plugin

<a href="http://blog.peteonrails.com/vote-fu/">VoteFu</a> is a voting mixin that allows you to extend your models to vote on one another. Largely based on <a href="http://www.juixe.com/techknow/index.php/2006/06/24/acts-as-voteable-rails-plugin">Cosmin Radoi's acts_as_voteable plugin</a>, VoteFu adds named_scope support, a set of generators to make using the plugin easier,  a :polymorphic association to the voting class (so you can have more than one model type perform votes), and some enhancements for Rails 2.1. 

I have simplified the code it requires to cast a vote down from three to one. After setting up your models with the proper mixin functionality, you can cast votes like this: 
<pre lang="ruby" line="1">
   voter.vote_for(voteable)
   # OR
   voter.vote_against(voteable)
  # OR
   voter.vote(voteable, [true | false] )
</pre>

You can also use the old acts_as_voteable sytnax (which will continue to be supported):

<pre lang="ruby" line="1">
  vote = Vote.new(:vote => true)
  m    = Model.find(params[:id])
  m.votes    << vote
  user.votes << vote
</pre>

I hope you find the plugin useful. Comments and feedback welcome. If there is enough demand, I'll open up a lighthouse project to track issues.
