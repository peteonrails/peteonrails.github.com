Sorry for the outage on this blog yesterday. My hosting provider upgraded to Rails 2.1, and I had cleverly forgotten to:

<pre lang="bash">
bash# rake freeze:rails:gems
</pre>

If this happens to you, and you make the unfortunate mistake of trying to instead update Typo to Rails 2.1 using: 
<pre lang="bash">
bash# rake rails:update
</pre>

You'll be in even worse trouble, unless you're prepared to do a lot of fixing: 
<pre lang="bash">
bash# Pete$ script/server
./script/../config/boot.rb:45:in `require': no such file to load -- ./script/../config/../vendor/rails/railties/lib/initializer (LoadError)
	from ./script/../config/boot.rb:45:in `load_initializer'
	from ./script/../config/boot.rb:38:in `run'
	from ./script/../config/boot.rb:11:in `boot!'
	from ./script/../config/boot.rb:109
	from script/server:2:in `require'
	from script/server:2
</pre>

Your best bet? Revert from source control and freeze Typo in your dev environment. If you're stuck without source control or a dev environment, let me know and I'll talk walk you through the alternate fix.
