A number of VoteFu users have asked me for help integrating VoteFu into their codebase. I recognize that this means I've probably left the documentation lacking in a couple of places, but in order to immediately help those folks who want a reference implementation of VoteFu, I am releasing the full source code of <a href="http://www.myquotable.com">MyQuotable.com</a>. 

MyQuotable was a fun distraction for me, but frankly, I really wrote it so I could have a POC application for VoteFu and a couple other plugins. it doesn't have any particularly useful Intellectual Property and it's not the Next Big Thing. So it doesn't make sense to keep the source closed. 

You can get the <a href="http://github.com/peteonrails/myquotable/tree/master">source code from GitHub.</a>
