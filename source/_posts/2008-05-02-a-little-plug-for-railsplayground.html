I host this blog with <a href="http://www.railsplayground.com">RailsPlayground</a>. Mostly, I never have to edit files on my hosted accounts, because I use robust deployment tools. However, today I had to tweak my .htaccess file and found that my shared host didn't have "emacs". 
</p>
<p>
Alright. Are you kidding me? No emacs? I know that most of the younguns these days use "vi" or something else to edit on UNIX. And that's FINE. "vi" is small (it fits on a floppy!) powerful, and a generally great editor. 
</p>
<p>
I simply come from the old school. When I was in college, someone asked my CS101 professor: "Mr. Anastasio, is there another UNIX editor I could use for my homework other than emacs?" 
</p>
<p> 
His reply: "No. If you are going to work in software, emacs is THE editor."
</p>
So I fired off this message to tech support: 
<typo:code>
I am loving the service so far. Very easy to set up and use. 

HOWEVER! I was surprised to see that you don't have emacs installed on your developer accounts. 

Any chance of getting it installed? 
I can use vi and other editors, but I'm a developer who comes from the "emacs is the only way" camp. :) 

Thanks!

I kid you not. TEN minutes later, I got this reply: 
<typo:code>
Hello Peter,

This is now installed on your server. 

Note that your account is on a shared server, so if you try to copy very large 
files it can use a lot of swap and memory space on the server. So if there are 
any issues, we will be forced to disable it. 
</typo:code>
<p>
Aside from not understanding how I might copy large files with emacs and run the server out of RAM, I think this is a GREAT answer. 
</p>
<p>
Thanks RailsPlayground!
