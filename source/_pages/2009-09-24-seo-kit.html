<h2>Installing</h2>
<pre><code>script/plugin install git://github.com/peteonrails/seo-kit.git
script/generate seo_kit
</code></pre>
<h2>What you get</h2>
<h3>Canonical link tag helpers</h3>
This is handy if you're using friendly_id or you have more than one way to see an instance of a particular model. Setting a canonical URL of the URL generated by the path helpers will ensure that search engines recognize the duplicate content and do not split page rank.

In your controllers:
<pre><code>def show
  @user = User.find(params[:id])
  canonical_url @user
end
</code></pre>
In your views:
<pre><code>&lt;%= canonical_link_tag %&gt;
</code></pre>
OR
<pre><code> = canonical_link_tag
</code></pre>
If you have app/views/layouts/application.html.haml and a "=yield :head"" call set up, then this is set up for you by default.
<h3>Sitemap Generators</h3>
The route /sitemap.xml will produce a valid sitemap for you. To update which models are included in the sitemap, see
<pre><code>config/initializers/seo.rb
</code></pre>
Add downcased model names to the SITEMAP_MODELS array to include more models. The kit ships with the user model set up for sitemapping (which is a bad idea if you do not have public profiles for your users):
<pre><code>SITEMAP_MODELS = %w(user)
</code></pre>
If you have a blog site, then do this:
<pre><code>SITEMAP_MODELS = %w(post comment category user)
</code></pre>
To include named routes or other URLs that we can't use generators (e.g. pages controlled by high_voltage), you can list them in the SITEMAP_URLS field. For example:
<pre><code>SITEMAP_URLS = [
  "http://mysite.org/faq.html",
  "http://mysite.org/about.html",
  "http://mysite.org/privacy.html"
</code></pre>
]
<h2>Notes</h2>
I strongly recommend that you also install the "friendly_id" plugin and use it to generate well-named links for your important models. Be sure to set canonical_urls on the show action in your controllers for these objects, since they will be addressable in two ways:

http://host/users/1 http://host/users/fasteragile

You want the canonical_url to be http://host/users/fasteragile
